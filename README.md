# Creating-A-Database
Hello:hand:,<br>
In this project, we will build a database from the ground up using the lessons we learned from the [Beginner-SQL-Codes](https://github.com/AdwoaAgyeiwaa/Beginner-SQL-Codes) repository.<br>
Are you ready???<br><br>

DISCLAIMER: I AM A NOVICE IN SQL PROGRAMMING. I AM JUST SHARING MY JOURNEY WITH YOU:smiley:
